# `libsstvenc`: A simple SSTV encoder library in C.

**THIS PROJECT IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS**.

The idea of this project is to provide a reasonable quality SSTV encoder
implementation in C for use in custom SSTV applications.

## Implemented modes:

- Robot 8, 12 and 24 monochrome modes
- Robot 36 and 72 colour modes
- Scottie S1, S2 and DX
- Martin M1 and M2
- Pasokon P3, P5 and P7
- PD-50, PD-90, PD-120, PD-160, PD-180, PD-240 and PD-290
- Wraase SC-2 120 and 180

## Current work:

- Fixing timing issues in the state machine which is throwing the timing off.
